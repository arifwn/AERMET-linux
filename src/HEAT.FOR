      SUBROUTINE HEAT(IHR)
C=====================================================================**
C          HEAT Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose: To calculate the heat flux, HFLUX, from the net radiation
C              and Bowen ratio.  The equation for the heat flux is:
C              (CONSTANT*NET RADIATION) / (1+(1/BOWEN RATIO))
C
C     Calling Arguments:
C             IHR      In    INTEGER   HOUR OF DAY
