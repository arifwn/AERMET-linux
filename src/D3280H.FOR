      SUBROUTINE D3280H(CARD32,NEWLOC,NEWYR,NEWMO,NEWDY,ISTAT)
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C     D3280H Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  To decode the station and date group from the TD3280-format
C               observations and return them to the main program.
C
C     Called by: GETSFC
C
C     Arguments:
C       CARD32   Input   Card image with surface data
C       NEWLOC   Output  Station identifier
C       NEWYR    Output  Year retrieved
C       NEWMO    Output  Month retrieved
C       NEWDY    Output  Day retrieved
C       NEWHR    Output  Hour retrieved
C       ISTAT    Output  Program status of the decode

C     Revision history:
C       11/30/94 - Made into a separate subroutine from an ENTRY point
C                  (PES, Inc.)
C
C       1/2010 - MACTEC
C         - Added capability to determine ASOS commission date for
C           for treatment of truncated ASOS wind speeds
C         - Checks for internal WBAN consistency. WBAN in control file
C           should = WBAN in NWS surface file which should contain only one

C     Store WBAN from first observation - this will be used to get
C     the commission date and check consistency between WBAN in 
C     control file and across all observations.
C
C     GETSFC.FOR assumes data is being read from tape and by-passes
C     observations for stations that do not match. It is doubtful
C     tape access is still in use.  It is assumed a single TD3280 met
C     file will contain data for only one WBAN.  WBAN should match
C     control file and be internally consistent.  Processing stops
C     if a mismatch is encountered. 

C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
C     Store WBAN From First Observation
C     Compare WBAN from control file to first obs WBAN
C        No match - error, abort
C     This assignment and check should only be performed once, after
C        the first observation was read.
C     For all subsequent observations, compare WBAN from current obs
C        to the WBAN stored from the first obs.
