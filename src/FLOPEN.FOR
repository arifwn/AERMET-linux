C        FLOPEN Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  To decipher user supplied input data and open a disk
C               file.
C
C               DEVNUM = unit number
C               DEVNAM = filename
C               KOUNT  = control file record number
C               CARD   = control file record image
C               ITYPE  = file type = new, old, unknown, ...
C               IFRMAT =
C               NWS    = archive type
C               BLKFAC = unused - see note below

C
C     Revision History:
C        05/29/08: MACTEC Engineering & Consulting
C                - Deleted assignment of BLKFAC and BLKSIZE
C                  NOTE: although BLKFAC is no longer used,
C                        it is passed as an argument; until the calling
C                        routines to FLOPEN are changed, BLKFAC
C                        needs to be retained, but unused.
C                - Removed record lengths and block sizes from
C                  OPEN statements
