AERMET v11059

ABOUT
-----

AERMET_ is a meteorological data preprocessor for AERMOD_, a steady-state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer turbulence structure and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain.  

This version of AERMET_ is slightly tweaked to compile under linux with 
gfortran compiler.
