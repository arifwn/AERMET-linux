c        Variables 35 through 40 are ASOS sky condition and layer height
c        for six layers ALC1 through ALC6.  We initialize the first layer
c        to missing.  The remaining layers are meaningful only if the first
c        layer is non-missing; consequently, these layers (variables 36-40)
c        are initialized to clear with an unlimited height.
