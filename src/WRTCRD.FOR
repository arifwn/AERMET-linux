      SUBROUTINE WRTCRD( IHDNUM,PREP,CARD,DEVICE )
C=====================================================================**
C          WRTCRD Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  Writes runstream record to a temporary file for
C               possible use later either in constructing headers
C               for output file(s), or for possible use in reporting
C               processing errors.
C
C     Initial Release: December 15, 1992
C
C     Revision History:
C        11/15/96
C          - added a call to subr.DEFINE (just before the call to
C            subr.FDPATH) to correct a recurrent error in stage 2
C            whereby the SURFACE and ONSITE pathways were not properly
C            identified in the merge file header records for stage 3
