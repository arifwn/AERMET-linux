      SUBROUTINE PRESET( ISTAGE )
C=====================================================================**
C          PRESET Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  This routine pre-reads runstream input file ('aermet.inp')
C               to determine which stage of processing is being performed
C               based on pathways included.
C               This allows better handling of file opens to include
C               STATUS='REPLACE' where appropriate to avoid re-reading
C               headers from previously failed runs.

C---- 1.  Initialize variables

C---- 2. Process the runstream images:
C        Note that data are read to BUF01*1 array, but are EQUIVALENCE'd 
C        to BUF80*80 in WORK1.INC.
C        Read data twice, once to BUF01*1(132) array, and once to larger
C        BUFFER500 variable, in order to check for information in the
C        runstream file that extends beyond column 132.
