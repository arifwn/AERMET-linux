      SUBROUTINE CBLHT( KK, KSDG, NUMLEV, HCUMUL, PBLHT )
C=====================================================================**
C          CBLHT Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  To compute the convective boundary layer height by
C               comparing the cumulative dayteim heat flux to the area
C               under the morning sounding potential temperature profile.

C                                      (AERMET processes cbl mixing
C                                       heights in 15-min increments)
C
C        KSDG      Input     Integer   Sounding for the day used in calcs
C
C        NUMLEV    Input     Integer   Number of levels in the profile,
C                                      including the extra level of the
C                                      sounding was extended to 5000 m
C
C        HCUMUL    Input     Real      Cumulative heat flux up to hour
C
C        PBLHT     Output    Real      Convective boundary layer height
C
C     Other I/O:
C        PTSUM     Input     Real      Summed area under the potential
