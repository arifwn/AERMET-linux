      SUBROUTINE GETASOS( KOUNT,CARD,CPATH,CKEY,IDEV,CNAME,ISTAT,HDR )
C=====================================================================**
C          GETASOS Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  Opens the 1-min ASOS wind data file identified on 
C               on the QAOUT keyword under the SURFACE pathway
C               in Stage 2. This routine is also used in Stage 3
C               to obtain the 1-min ASOS data filename, without 
C               opening.  The HDR variable is used to determine
C               whether or not to open the file.
C
C     Called By: UACARD, SFCARD, OSCARD, AERSURF

C     Form:  keyword  filename

C            keyword   = keyword: MESSAGES, REPORT, EXTRACT, QAOUT, OUTPUT
