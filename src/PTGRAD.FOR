      SUBROUTINE PTGRAD ( NUM, NLEV, SDGTOP, ZI, DTHDZ )
C=====================================================================**
C          PTGRAD Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     PURPOSE:  To compute the vertical potential temperature gradient
C               above the convective mixing height (ZI) in a layer from
C               ZI to ZI+DELZ (meters); the larger of the computed value
C               and a minimum default value is returned.

C     Called by:  MPPBL
C
C     Arguments:
C        NUM       Integer   Input     Sounding number for the day
C        NLEV      Integer   Input     Number of levels in the sounding
C        SDGTOP    Real      Input     The height of the top of the
C                                      UN-extended sounding
C        ZI        Real      Input     Convective mixing height,
C                                      computed in MPPBL
C        DTHDZ     Real      Output    Vertical potential temperature
C                                      gradient over the layer ZI to
C                                      ZI+DELZ (DELZ defined below)

C     Other I/O:
C
C
C     Assumptions:
C        - The height and potential temperature profiles contain no
C          missing data

C     Revision history:
C        10/31/96 (PES)
C          - check is made to determine if a 500 m layer or 250 m layer
C            is used in the computation or if a default value should be
C            used; counters and accumulators added for statistics on
C            the vptg; computation moved to (new) subr.COMPDT
