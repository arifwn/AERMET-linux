      SUBROUTINE UCALST(IHR, ANGLE, ACRIT)
C=====================================================================**
C     UCALST Module of the AERMET Meteorological Preprocessor
C
C     Purpose:  Calculate USTAR (friction velocity) and THSTAR (the
C               temperature scale for profiling).  A check is used to see
C               if the solution to USTAR will be either real or complex.
C               If the solution is real, the computation for USTAR
C               follows the solution proposed by Venkatram.  If the
C               solution is complex, a linear interpolation, used by
C               van Ulden and Holtslag, is applied to find the solution.
C
C     Input:
C      IHR       Integer   Hour of day
C      ANGLE     Real      Solar elevation angle

C      ACRIT     Real      Solar elevation angle above which net radiation
C                          is positive

C      WSPD      Real      Wind speed at reference height
C      ZO        Real      Surface roughness length
C      ZREF      Real      Reference height for wind speed
C      CCVR      Real      Cloud cover
C      T         Real      Ambient temperature at reference height
C
C     Output:
C      USTAR     Real      Surface friction velocity
C      THSTAR    Real      Temperature scale for profiling

C     Revision history:
C        07/30/95 (PES)
C          - added the computation for theta_star when the solution to
C            the quadratic equation is complex-valued;
C
C        09/05/97 (PES)
C          - changed the constant BETAM from 4.7 to 5.0
c
c        04/24/01  (JSI)
c          - added code implementing Holtslag's correction term for theta-star.
c
c        05/01/01  (RJP)
c          - altered treatment of case in stable conditions where the
c            quadratic equation has no real solution.  Although u* and 
c            theta* may vanish at low speeds, the manner in which they
c            both vary is currently assumed to be linear with speed below
c            the threshold required for a real solution, which may not be
c            correct, and which may lead to unrealistically low M-O lengths. 
c            Furthermore, many low speed measurements are questionable 
c            because they may be near or below the instrument starting speed.  
c            Instead of having u* and theta* vanish at low wind speeds, 
c            theta* is retained in this treatment and a minimum 
c            u* equivalent to the lowest wind speed leading to a real 
c            solution is used.

c        05/18/01  (JSI)
c          - revised implementation of theta-star correction so that it applies
c            only for low solar elevations.
C
c        08/14/01  (DTB)
c          - removed code for the calculation of heat flux;  redundent code
c            is located in the calling program MPPBL.
c
c        08/28/01  (PES, RWB)
c          - reverted to original linear scaling for estimating ustar
c            and thstar for cases when quadratric equation has no real
c            solution.
c
c        07/23/04  (MACTEC/PES, RWB)
c          - included check for missing wind speed.
